# Alpacka landing page

This is a recreation of one of the designs of the super-talented [Gil Huybrecht](https://www.instagram.com/gil.huybrecht/?hl=en). I am a huge fan of his work and when I saw this particular hero section design/prototype, I decided to recreate it using HTML, CSS and JS. It is a hero section of the landing page of one of his ongoing project for Alpacka. It was a lot of fun figuring out the right timing and easing for the animations. Those are two key parts of a good animation.

## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript/GSAP

### What I learned

I always see a new project as an opportunity to learn something new. And web explorations like this gives me that opportunity. 
Before starting the project, I already figured that I was going to have an issue getting all the moving parts in the hero section move in at the right time. It had to be smooth. To achieve the animation, I created two GSAP timelines - ***counterTL*** and ***heroSectionTl***. 
The ***counterTl*** timeline contained the preloader counter, alpacka logo and getting to slide up the preloader screen on completion of the counter.
The ***heroSectionTl*** timeline contained the animations on the hero section ranging from the navigation, video media and its paragraph.
The animations are contained in the *script.js* file.

So working on this project gave me the opportunity to learn and improve my animation sequencing skills.
